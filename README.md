## Description üìù

This repo contains code for a fake ecommerce backend. 

Through the usage of mainly sequelize and mysql2, we're able to access MySQL databases, get information about products, create new entries in the database's tables, update information in our database, and delete information from our database.

## Learning Points üìñ

The biggest learning point through the creation of this application, for me, was the power of MySQL databases in applications as well as how to manipulate databases through JavaScript thanks to node modules such as Sequelize and MySQL2.

An example of how I accessed MySQL databases can be found below:

```JavaScript
router.put('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  // update a category by its `id` value
  try{
    const categoryData = Category.update(req.body, {
      where: {
        id: req.params.id
      }
    });
    if(!categoryData){
      res.status(400).json({message: 'No category with this id exists'})
    }
    res.status(200).json({message: 'Category has been updated'})
  }catch(err){
    res.status(500).json(err)
  }
});
```

To go into more detail about the code above, this code snippet represents my put route for my /api/categories/:id route.

This code will take the user given id (through req.params.id) and update the category entry whose id is the same as the user given id. The updated information is given through req.body (which is the user's input).

If the user chooses to update a category that isn't present in the category table (i.e. they give the wrong id), then it will tell the user that no category exists with the given id.

If the id exists, then the entry in the category table will be updated with whatever the user gives us. 

If everything else fails, it assumes that the server is dead and sends the 500 status.
